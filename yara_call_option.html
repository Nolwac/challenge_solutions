	<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Yara Inc is listed on the NYSE with a stock price of $ \$40 $ - the company is not known to pay dividends. We need to price a call option with a strike of $ \$45 $ maturing in 4 months. The continuously-compounded risk-free rate is 3%/year, the mean return on the
stock is 7%/year, and the standard deviation of the stock return is 40%/year. What is the Black-Scholes call price?</h3>
	<article style="white-space: pre-line;font-weight: bold; font-size: 15px;">
	  <content><h2>Solution</h2></center>
	  Black-Scholes call price, denoted as $c$ is given by:
	  $$c = SN(d1) - Xe^{-rT}N(d2)$$
	  where $$d1 = \frac{ln(S/X) + (r + \alpha^2/2)T}{\alpha \sqrt T }$$
	  $$ d2 = d1 - \alpha \sqrt T $$
	  $N(d) =$ area under the standard normal distribution curve for $z = d$
	  $S =$ stock price $= 40$
	  $X =$ strike price $= 45$
	  $r =$ risk free rate $= 3 percent = 0.03$
	  $\alpha =$ standard deviation $= 40 percent = 0.4$
	  hence $\alpha^2 = 0.16$
	  $T = 4$ months $= 1/3$
	  substituting the values into $d1$ :
	  $$ d1 = \frac{ln(40/45) + (0.03 + 0.16/2)\times 1/3}{0.4 \sqrt {1/3}} $$
	  $$\approx -0.3512$$
	  But the mean return on stock is $7 percent = 0.07$ This implies that the mean is shifted with respect to the standard normal distribution model, hence to account for the shift, we need to add the mean value to $d1$ which is the $z$ value.
	  therefore:
	  $$d1 = -0.3512 + 0.07 = -0.2812$$
	  hence:
	  $$d2 = -0.2812 - 0.4 \sqrt {1/3} = -0.5121$$
	  Using the standard z-table for normal distribution:
	  $N(d1) = 0.38928$ and $N(d2) = 0.30429$
	  Hence we can now calculate for $C$ using the given values and the calculated values.
	  $$ C = 40 \times 0.38928 - 45 \times e^{0.03 \times 1/3} \times 0.30429$$
	  $$= 2.0144$$
	  Hence the Black-Scholes call price is $\$2.0144$
