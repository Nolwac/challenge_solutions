	<h1 style="font-weight: bold;">Why it is a bad idea to use recursion method to find the fibonacci of a number</h1>
	<article style="white-space: pre-line;font-weight: bold; font-size: 15px;">
	  The reason why recursive method of finding the fibonacci of a number is bad compared to the iterative method is because of the time and space complexity. To understand what this actually means it is necessary to take a look at the recursive code and the iterative code.
	  <pre>def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    else:
    	return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
#code written in Python</pre>
  so let's consider when $n > 1$, then we can say that:
  $$T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2) + 4$$
  where $T(n)$ is the time taken to run the function, $fib(n)$ and
  the constant, 4 represents 1 comparison, 2 subtractions and 1 addition that was done in the function
  Let’s say c = 4 and try to first establish a lower bound by approximating that T(n-1) ~ T(n-2) , though T(n-1) ≥ T(n-2), hence lower bound

		$$T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2) + c$$
		     $$ = 2T(n-2) + c$$   since from the approximation $T(n-1) \approx T(n-2)$
		     $$= 2 \times (2T(n-4) + c) + c$$
		     $$= 4T(n-4) + 3c$$
		     $$= 8T(n-6) + 7c$$
		     $$= 2^k \times T(n - 2k) + (2^k - 1) \times c$$
		The last call in the call stack is when $n - 2k = 0$
		hence we find the value of k at that point when $n - 2k = 0$
		$$k = n/2$$
		$$T(n) = 2^{n/2} \times T(0) + (2^{n/2} - 1) \times c$$
		     $$= 2^{n/2} \times (1 + c) - c$$
		i.e. $$T(n) \approx 2^{n/2}$$
		
    now for the upper bound, we can approximate $T(n-2) \approx T(n-1)$ as $T(n-2) ≤ T(n-1)$
    $$T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2) + c$$
      $$= 2T(n-1) + c$$
      since from the approximation $T(n-1) \approx T(n-2)$
      $$= 2 \times (2T(n-2) + c) + c$$
      $$= 4T(n-2) + 3c$$
      $$= 8T(n-3) + 7c$$
      $$= 2^k \times T(n - k) + (2^k - 1) \times c$$
    Let's find the value of k for which: $n - k = 0$
    $$k = n$$
    $$T(n) = 2^n \times T(0) + (2^n - 1) \times c$$
       $$= 2^n \times (1 + c) - c$$
    i.e. $$T(n) \approx 2^n$$
    Hence we can conclude that the time taken by recursive Fibonacci is $O(2^n)$ or exponential.
    
    The space complexity is a the depth of the call recursive call stack, as those are stored in the memory for reference. Hence the space complexity will be $O(n)$ 
    
    Now let's consider the time and space complexity for the iterative method.
    A sample code for the iterative method is shown below.
    <pre>def fib(n):
    first = 1
    second = 1
    current = 1
    while n>=2:
    	current = first + second
    	first = second
    	second = current
    	n = n -1
    return current
#written in Python
    </pre>
    Looking at the program above, we cam deduce that:
    $$T(n) = 7n + 3$$
    where the coefficient $6$ represents 1 comparison taking place at the condition for the loop to execute, 4 assignments, 1 subtraction and 1 addition taking place inside the loop and the constant value $3$ represents the 3 assignment above the while loop.
    Hence we can say that the time complexity for the iterative fibonacci is $ \approx O(n)$ which is linear time.
    Then the space complexity of the iterative fibonacci is $\approx O(c)$ which is constant space, this is because no matter the depth of the loop, only 4 memory locations used in storing the values of the variables $first$, $second$, $current$ and $n$ are used.
    
    <h2>With this we can conclude that recursive approach of finding the fibonacci of a number is a bad idea since it takes more time and computing memory to execute</h2>
