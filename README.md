## Application for the position of a cryptocurrency research assistant.
This repository was created with the sole purpose of solving the challenges associated with the application for the position of a cryptocurrency research assistant.

Below are the questions and the links to my solutions to the problem.

## Question 1 (Finance).
The question has 2 parts.
- Write a 500-word explanation of Bitcoin stock-to-flow model and make an argument for why it is a bad model?
#### Solution
I have written the 500 words article in a Markdown format for readability on GitHub. [Here is the markdown file][stock_to_flow].

- (Please show your workings). Yara Inc is listed on the NYSE with a stock price of $40. The company is not known to pay dividends. We need to price a call option with a strike of $45 maturing in 4 months. The continuously-compounded risk-free rate is 3%/year, the mean return on the
stock is 7%/year, and the standard deviation of the stock return is 40%/year. What is the Black-Scholes call price?
#### Solution
I hosted this repository on GitHub pages, so I showed my solution through MathJax on a HTML webpage. [Here is the link to the math solution][yara_call_option].

## Question 2 (Computer Science).
The question has 2 parts.
- Why is it a bad idea to use recursion method to find the fibonacci of a number?
#### Solution
I as well showed the solution to this problem using MathJax on a HTML webpage to illustrate mathematically why using recursion is a bad idea. [Here is the link to the math solution][recursive_fibonacci].

- Write a function that takes in a Proth Number and uses Proth's theorem to determine if said number is prime? You can write this in any programming language but C/C++/Golang are preferred.
#### Solution
I wrote the program in Python. [Here is the link to the Python program file][proth_prime].

## Question 3 (Mathematics).
- (Please show your workings). Over all real numbers, find the minimum value of a positive real number, y such that
#### y = sqrt((x+6)^2 + 25) + sqrt((x-6)^2 + 121)
#### Solution
I showed the solution to this problem using MathJax on a HTML webpage. [Here is the link to the math solution][minimum_value].
